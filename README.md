# Calibrating-Bank-Churners
This project seeks to analyze a dataset of bank churners to predict customer attrition, identifying factors contributing to customer churn and building models to forecast which customers are likely to churn. 

Why Analyze Churn?
- Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
- Insights from churn analysis can help businesses reduce revenue loss.
- Predictive models can enable proactive retention strategies, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus lowering the probability of churning.

In this project, we will consider and possibly provide answers to questions such as:
1. **Who is at risk of churning?**
2. **What kind of factors influence churn?**
3. **How do churn patterns vary across different demographics?**
4. **What kind of steps can the bank follow to avoid reduce churn?**
